1. The Boston Housing Dataset (Boston dataset) can be accessed throught **library(MASS)** in R
3. The GitHub repository that containing the R codes required to build the Shiny App (**server.R** and **ui.R**) can be accessed [here](https://github.com/jgvelascoo/DevelopingDataProductsR)
2. The Shiny app can be accessed [here](https://jvelascoo.shinyapps.io/BostonDatasetApp/), which contains
